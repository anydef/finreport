# TODO

Requirements live in `docs/requirements.md`; per-iteration specs in `docs/specs/`.

## Status

| Iteration | Scope | State |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | Event-sourced MVP: Kafka → projector → Postgres → GraphQL → UI, auth, cash-flow views | merged, deployed |
| 2 | Categories, LLM labeling, rules engine, review queue, rules/category admin UI | merged, deployed |
| 3 | Tags, transfer detection, recurring detection (`docs/specs/iteration-3.md`) | merged; no final Opus review yet |

Deployment: frontend (`finreport.lab.anydef.de`, .50), one-shot migrate service (.51),
admin bootstrap (password in 1Password "finreport admin"), services on 192.168.100.45+.
See `docs/runbooks/iteration-1-deploy.md`.

## Next, in order

1. Review iteration 3 against real data (`just dev-demo`, then the deployed stack).
2. Iteration 4: savings and spending goals (see requirements).
3. Admin user management in the UI.
4. Bank connections via UI: credentials, sync, TAN status. **Blocked on a user
   decision about credential storage** (security-critical).
5. C24, PayPal and Scalable Capital integrations. First research the access
   method for each (API vs. CSV fallback).
6. Sankey cash-flow views.

## Open debt

- Pre-existing prettier issue in `finreport-fe/src/lib/graphql/schema.graphql`
  (the mirrored SDL is not prettier-formatted).
- The root `README.md` still documents `sqlx-cli`; the project uses `sea-orm-cli`.
