# TODO

Requirements live in `docs/requirements.md`; per-iteration specs in `docs/specs/`.

## Status

| Iteration | Scope | State |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | Event-sourced MVP: Kafka → projector → Postgres → GraphQL → UI, auth, cash-flow views | merged, deployed |
| 2 | Categories, LLM labeling, rules engine, review queue, rules/category admin UI | merged, deployed |
| 3 | Tags, transfer detection, recurring detection (`docs/specs/iteration-3.md`) | merged; no final Opus review yet |

Deployment: frontend (`finreport.lab.anydef.de`, .50), one-shot migrate service (.51),
admin bootstrap (password in 1Password "finreport admin"), services on 192.168.100.45+.
See `docs/runbooks/iteration-1-deploy.md`.

## Next, in order

Agreed work, in priority order. Feature requests land in the Backlog below
first; they move up here only once their priority is settled.

1. Review iteration 3 against real data — **done** (see `docs/specs/iteration-3.md`;
   the live-data pass found the missing `source_account_id` envelope header and
   the repair tool that recovers it).
2. Iteration 4: savings and spending goals (`docs/specs/iteration-4.md`).
   WP0 contracts merged; WP-C (UI on mocks) next, for review before WP-A/WP-B.
3. Admin user management in the UI.
4. Bank connections via UI: credentials, sync, TAN status. **Blocked on a user
   decision about credential storage** (security-critical).
5. C24, PayPal and Scalable Capital integrations. First research the access
   method for each (API vs. CSV fallback).
6. Sankey cash-flow views.

## Backlog

Recorded feature requests, not yet prioritised. The estimate is effort, the
note is what makes it worth more or less than its cost. Pull one into "Next"
by agreeing where it goes.

- **Spending-by-category drill-down** — S, frontend-only. The `uncategorized`
  and `needs-review` rows are rendered as buttons but do nothing; category rows
  already work. Cheapest item here and fixes something that currently looks
  broken, so a reasonable candidate to pull forward.
- **Clickable affordances** — S, frontend-only. Clickable things should look
  clickable: `cursor-pointer`, a hover state, and a visible focus ring. Today
  the frontend has only 3 `cursor-pointer` usages against ~10 components with
  click handlers (Sankey nodes, breakdown rows, badges, tag chips, review
  cards), so most click targets are indistinguishable from text. Cheap, and it
  cuts across every other UI item here, so it is worth doing early — ideally as
  shared classes or a small `clickable` helper rather than per-component
  one-offs. The inverse matters too: `CategoryBreakdown`'s `uncategorized` and
  `needs-review` rows currently *look* like buttons and do nothing, so
  affordance and behaviour must be fixed together (see the drill-down item).

- **Split transactions are invisible in the tables** — S, frontend-only.
  `TransactionTable` never renders a transaction's `splits`, so a split row is
  indistinguishable from a plain one — on the goal pages this is misleading,
  since goal totals count splits *by their parts* (iteration 4 §3.1) while the
  table shows the whole amount under one category. Needs at least a split
  badge and the parts on expand. Found while building goal fixtures.

- **Server-calculated running total for fixed-range goals** — S backend, S
  frontend. The Holiday-fund chart currently adds the transactions up in the
  browser, and it only fetches the first 200 of them, so a goal with more
  transactions than that draws a line that stops early. Moving the calculation
  to the server means adding a series of running totals to `GoalProgress` and
  having the goals resolver fill it. Accepted as good enough for now
  (2026-10-07); do this before any goal accumulates more than ~200
  transactions, which for a monthly goal is a few years.
- **Dynamic filter conditions on a goal's scope** — M. A goal's scope today is
  a fixed shape: a list of categories, a list of tags, and one choice of
  whether both must match or either. When both are given, both must match
  (confirmed 2026-10-07). The richer version lets the user build the condition
  themselves — nested groups of and/or, negation, and conditions on fields
  beyond category and tag. This replaces the `combine`/`tagCombine` flags with
  a small expression tree, in the event, the projection and the query, so it is
  worth doing deliberately rather than by growing the flags one at a time.
- **Dead-letter record for projector records that cannot be applied** — M. When
  the projector cannot map a record it logs the reason, skips it, and commits
  its position anyway, so the record is never revisited and the only evidence
  disappears with the container's logs. This is how 139 transactions and 832
  balance observations stayed missing for two months. Agreed approach
  (2026-10-07): write the skipped record into a table marked as failed, which
  makes it queryable and replayable, rather than a separate Kafka topic. Should
  carry the topic, partition, offset, key, headers, the raw value and the
  mapper's error, and a way to mark one resolved once it has been dealt with.

- **Transaction detail modal** — M, frontend-only. Edit category, splits, tags
  and the recurring flag from any list. Every mutation it needs already exists.
  Also extracts a shared `TransactionItem`, which the two items below both
  build on — doing it first makes them cheaper.
- **Dashboard transaction filters** — M. Mostly surfacing controls
  `/transactions` already has; the only backend work is `amountMin`/`amountMax`
  on `TransactionFilter`. Two open decisions (signed vs magnitude; whether the
  panel narrows the charts too).
- **Table search, multi-select and bulk tag/category edit** — L, needs backend
  work. The largest of these: bulk mutations, tag add/remove rather than
  whole-set replace, a selection model that means "all matching" not "this
  page", and non-atomic partial-failure handling. Highest leverage once the
  taxonomy is in use and many transactions need re-filing; least worth doing
  before then.

## Open debt

- Pre-existing prettier issue in `finreport-fe/src/lib/graphql/schema.graphql`
  (the mirrored SDL is not prettier-formatted).
- The root `README.md` still documents `sqlx-cli`; the project uses `sea-orm-cli`.
